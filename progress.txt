Task: 002
Status: done

What I did:
- Reset all 5 tasks in prds/999_dry_run_test.json to testsPassing: false
- Verified all tasks now have testsPassing: false so users can run through the test cycle

Files modified:
- prds/999_dry_run_test.json: Reset all testsPassing flags from true to false

Commit: (pending - will be included with other changes)
Notes: Dry run PRD is now ready for new users to test their Ralph setup.

Task: 004
Status: done

What I did:
- Expanded Key Files table into two sections: Machine-level and Project-level
- Added Source column showing where each file comes from
- Added intro text to Part 3 clarifying files go in project root
- Updated Step 3.9 title and added clarifying text about copying from ~/ralph-docker/

Files modified:
- README.md: Enhanced Key Files section and Step 3.9

Commit: (pending - will be included with other changes)
Notes: Users can now clearly understand: (1) which files go to ~/ralph-docker/ vs project root, (2) what the source of each file is, (3) which setup is one-time vs per-project.

Task: 005
Status: done

What I did:
- Added "Dry Run Test (No Git Commits)" section to Part 7: Running Ralph
- Documented the command to run dry run: ./ralph-loop.sh prds/999_dry_run_test.json
- Explained what dry run does (edits only PRD file, no git commits)
- Documented what success looks like (5 iterations, COMPLETE signal)
- Added instructions for resetting the dry run PRD for reuse

Files modified:
- README.md: Added dry run testing section after "Test with Single Iteration First"

Commit: (pending - will be committed with this sprint's changes)
Notes: Users can now test their Ralph setup safely before running real tasks.
