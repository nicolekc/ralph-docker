PRD: 001_normalize_repo_structure
Task: 002
Status: done

What I did:
- Compared all 5 Ralph scripts (ralph-start.sh, ralph-clone.sh, ralph-once.sh, ralph-loop.sh, ralph-reset.sh) between README.md heredoc versions and actual files
- Documented key differences found:
  - ralph-start.sh: Actual uses named volumes (better), README used anonymous volumes
  - ralph-once.sh: Actual is simplified (no logging), README had full logging - simplified is appropriate for quick testing
  - ralph-clone.sh: Minor differences in volume mounts
  - ralph-loop.sh and ralph-reset.sh: Nearly identical
- Determined actual files are canonical (improved/updated versions)
- Updated README.md Step 1.7 to remove embedded heredocs, now links to actual files with a table
- Updated README.md Step 3.9 to reference actual files
- Removed ~340 lines of duplicated script content from README

Commit: 165a9a3
Notes: README is now significantly shorter and references the actual scripts as source of truth.

PRD: 001_normalize_repo_structure
Task: 003
Status: done

What I did:
- Replaced 8 heredoc blocks in README with copy commands referencing actual files
- Added markdown links to all template and script files for easy navigation
- Reduced README from ~1254 lines to ~965 lines (~290 lines removed)
- Renumbered steps 3.5-3.12 to 3.5-3.13 for proper sequencing
- Preserved only necessary heredocs: Dockerfile (users create in ralph-docker) and .gitignore append (small addition)
- Verified all 14 linked files exist and paths work as relative links

Files modified:
- README.md: Restructured to reference files instead of embedding
- prds/001_normalize_repo_structure.json: Marked task 003 complete

Commit: 337615c
Notes: README is now a proper documentation hub. All file contents are in actual files, README links to them.

PRD: 001_normalize_repo_structure
Task: 004
Status: done

What I did:
- Added "Repository Structure" section to README.md after the intro
- Created visual directory tree showing all files and directories
- Explained purpose of each file and directory:
  - Root scripts (ralph-*.sh, Dockerfile) for machine-level setup
  - templates/ for files users copy to their projects
  - prds/ for PRD templates and tools
  - ralph-logs/ for iteration logs (gitignored)
- Added "Key distinction" section explaining which files go where

Files modified:
- README.md: Added Repository Structure section (~39 lines)
- prds/001_normalize_repo_structure.json: Marked task 004 complete

Commit: 55f948d
Notes: Users can now see the repo structure at a glance.

2026-01-22T23:55:00Z
PRD: 002_readme_cleanup
Task: 002
Status: done

What I did:
- Reset all 5 tasks in prds/999_dry_run_test.json to testsPassing: false
- Verified all tasks now have testsPassing: false so users can run through the test cycle

Files modified:
- prds/999_dry_run_test.json: Reset all testsPassing flags from true to false

Commit: 06331ae (included with other changes)
Notes: Dry run PRD is now ready for new users to test their Ralph setup.

2026-01-23T00:05:00Z
PRD: 002_readme_cleanup
Task: 004
Status: done

What I did:
- Expanded Key Files table into two sections: Machine-level and Project-level
- Added Source column showing where each file comes from
- Added intro text to Part 3 clarifying files go in project root
- Updated Step 3.10 title and added clarifying text about copying scripts

Files modified:
- README.md: Enhanced Key Files section and Step 3.10

Commit: 06331ae (included with other changes)
Notes: Users can now clearly understand: (1) which files go to ~/ralph-docker/ vs project root, (2) what the source of each file is, (3) which setup is one-time vs per-project.

PRD: 002_readme_cleanup
Task: 005
Status: done

What I did:
- Added "Dry Run Test (No Git Commits)" section to Part 7: Running Ralph
- Documented the command to run dry run: ./ralph-loop.sh prds/999_dry_run_test.json
- Explained what dry run does (edits only PRD file, no git commits)
- Documented what success looks like (5 iterations, COMPLETE signal)
- Added instructions for resetting the dry run PRD for reuse

Files modified:
- README.md: Added dry run testing section after "Test with Single Iteration First"

Commit: 06331ae (included with other changes)
Notes: Users can now test their Ralph setup safely before running real tasks.

2026-01-23T01:30:00Z
PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 001
Status: done

What I did:
- Created .claude/skills/ directory structure
- Created .claude/skills/discover/SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- Skill contains project exploration instructions (tech stack, project structure, coding patterns, testing setup, dev server)
- Moved long prompt from README Step 3.4 into the skill
- Added new Step 3.4: Copy Claude Code Skills (copies .claude/skills/ directory)
- Changed Step 3.5 to: Run Project Discovery (runs /discover skill)
- Renumbered Steps 3.6-3.14 (previously 3.5-3.13)
- Updated Step 3.14 commit command to include .claude/ directory

Files modified:
- .claude/skills/discover/SKILL.md (new)
- README.md (restructured Step 3.4-3.14)

Commit: a454549
Notes: The discover skill replaces the embedded prompt, making project discovery simpler (/discover vs copy-paste). This establishes the skills infrastructure that Task 002 (refine skill) will build upon.

PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 002
Status: done

What I did:
- Created .claude/skills/refine/ directory
- Created .claude/skills/refine/SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- Skill instructions cover: right-sized tasks, too big (split), too small (merge), dependencies, acceptance criteria quality
- Output format: KEEP/SPLIT/MERGE/FIX for each task, or "PRD is ready"
- Kept PRD_REFINE.md as reference doc (skill uses same criteria)
- Updated README Step 3.4 to document both discover and refine skills
- Updated README Step 3.10 to note PRD_REFINE.md is reference for the skill
- Updated README Steps 4.3 and 5.3 to use /refine command instead of manual prompt
- Updated Quick Reference to mention /refine

Files modified:
- .claude/skills/refine/SKILL.md (new)
- README.md (updated skill docs and PRD refinement workflow)

Commit: b3d1a08
Notes: The refine skill simplifies PRD quality checking. Users now run /refine <prd-path> instead of manually referencing PRD_REFINE.md. This unblocks Task 003 (install script) and Task 008 (remove new-prd.sh).

2026-01-23T03:00:00Z
PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 003
Status: done

What I did:
- Created install.sh script in repo root
- Script copies all necessary files to target project:
  - CLAUDE.md.template → CLAUDE.md (only if doesn't exist)
  - progress.txt.template → progress.txt (only if doesn't exist)
  - .claudeignore, RALPH_PROMPT.md, UI_TESTING.md
  - ralph-loop.sh, ralph-once.sh (made executable)
  - prds/PRD_TEMPLATE.json, prds/PRD_REFINE.md
  - .claude/skills/discover/SKILL.md, .claude/skills/refine/SKILL.md
  - .git-hooks/pre-push (made executable, configured git hooks path)
  - Updates .gitignore to exclude ralph-logs/
- Script is idempotent: detects unchanged files, backs up changed files, creates only missing files
- Script verifies target is a git repository
- Dramatically simplified README Part 3 from 14 steps to 5 steps
- Updated time estimate from ~15 min to ~5 min
- Updated Repository Structure to include install.sh
- Updated Key Files tables in Quick Reference to show install.sh as source
- Removed new-prd.sh from repository structure diagram (anticipating Task 008)
- Updated Commands table to include install.sh

Files modified:
- install.sh (new)
- README.md (simplified Part 3, updated Quick Reference)

Commit: d1a533f
Notes: Part 3 is now: clone Ralph → run install.sh → run /discover → commit. This unblocks other documentation tasks and makes onboarding much faster.

PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 004
Status: done

What I did:
- Removed Step 1.2 (Install Claude Code) and Step 1.3 (Authenticate Claude Code) from Part 1
- Added note in Step 1.4 that Claude Code is pre-installed in Docker image and users don't need it on their Mac
- Added warning about never using --dangerously-skip-permissions with local Claude Code
- Renumbered Part 1 steps (1.4→1.2, 1.5→1.3, 1.6→1.4, 1.7→1.5, 1.8→1.6)
- Updated Part 1 time estimate from ~60 min to ~45 min
- Added "First container setup: ~10 minutes (authentication)" to Time Budget
- Completely restructured Part 4 to start with entering container first:
  - Step 4.1: Enter the Container
  - Step 4.2: Authenticate (First Run Only) - Claude auth AND gh auth together
  - Step 4.3: Quick Assessment (inside container)
  - Step 4.4-4.7: Generate PRD, refine, commit, run
- Simplified Part 5 to remove implication of running Claude on Mac
- Updated Quick Reference Daily Workflow to show container-first approach

Files modified:
- README.md (restructured Parts 1, 4, 5, and Quick Reference)

Commit: af8a74e
Notes: Auth flow now correctly reflects per-container authentication happening inside the container after ralph-start.sh. No more false claims about auth being shared across containers.

PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 005
Status: done

What I did:
- Added "Why Ralph?" section after title, before Time Budget
- Explains 5 key benefits: Docker isolation, automated feedback loop, incremental commits, human oversight, GitHub protection
- Moved "Key insight" content from Summary section to new section at top
- Section is concise (~12 lines including the key insight paragraph)
- Removed redundant "Key insight" line from Summary section

Files modified:
- README.md (added Why Ralph? section, removed duplicate Key insight)

Commit: 54abda7
Notes: Benefits section provides clear value proposition before diving into setup instructions. New users now understand WHY to use Ralph before learning HOW.

2026-01-23T06:00:00Z
PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 006
Status: done

What I did:
- Replaced verbose ASCII directory tree (26 lines, including code block) with markdown table
- Table shows 12 key files/directories with concise purpose descriptions
- Directory entries (templates/, prds/, .claude/skills/, ralph-logs/) explain what kinds of files they contain
- Condensed "Key distinction" section into simpler "Where things go" bullet points
- Net reduction of 17 lines while improving scannability

Files modified:
- README.md (replaced Repository Structure section)

Commit: 309af1a
Notes: The markdown table is much easier to scan than the ASCII tree. Users can now quickly see what's in the repo without parsing nested structure.

2026-01-23T07:00:00Z
PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 008
Status: done

What I did:
- Deleted prds/new-prd.sh helper script
- Verified README already documents natural language PRD creation workflow (Parts 4.4, 5.1)
- Verified no references to new-prd.sh exist in README
- Verified install.sh does not copy new-prd.sh (confirmed in Task 003)
- Workflow is now: describe feature → Claude creates PRD → /refine → run Ralph

Files modified:
- prds/new-prd.sh (deleted)

Commit: e6e10bb
Notes: The new-prd.sh script was redundant. Claude Code creates better PRDs from natural language than a bash script could with template substitution.

---
2026-01-23T08:00:00Z
PRD: 003_readme_modernization.json
Task: 010
Status: done

What I did:
- Restructured Part 7 (Running Ralph) for logical flow: enter container → verify → dry run → real PRD
- Moved "Dry Run Test" section BEFORE "Run a Real PRD" (was after)
- Removed `tail -f progress.txt` from monitoring instructions (doesn't work well)
- Removed vague "If something's wrong, fix your CLAUDE.md or RALPH_PROMPT.md and try again" advice
- Added step numbers (7.1-7.7) for consistent structure
- Simplified and clarified instructions throughout Part 7
- Users will now test their setup with dry run before wasting a real PRD iteration

Files modified:
- README.md (restructured Part 7)
- prds/003_readme_modernization.json (marked task 010 complete)

Commit: fdcd34d
Notes: Part 7 now follows the recommended flow: setup → verify → dry run → real run. Users won't discover setup issues on their first real PRD.
