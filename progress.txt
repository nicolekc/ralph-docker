PRD: 001_normalize_repo_structure
Task: 002
Status: done

What I did:
- Compared all 5 Ralph scripts (ralph-start.sh, ralph-clone.sh, ralph-once.sh, ralph-loop.sh, ralph-reset.sh) between README.md heredoc versions and actual files
- Documented key differences found:
  - ralph-start.sh: Actual uses named volumes (better), README used anonymous volumes
  - ralph-once.sh: Actual is simplified (no logging), README had full logging - simplified is appropriate for quick testing
  - ralph-clone.sh: Minor differences in volume mounts
  - ralph-loop.sh and ralph-reset.sh: Nearly identical
- Determined actual files are canonical (improved/updated versions)
- Updated README.md Step 1.7 to remove embedded heredocs, now links to actual files with a table
- Updated README.md Step 3.9 to reference actual files
- Removed ~340 lines of duplicated script content from README

Commit: 165a9a3
Notes: README is now significantly shorter and references the actual scripts as source of truth.

PRD: 001_normalize_repo_structure
Task: 003
Status: done

What I did:
- Replaced 8 heredoc blocks in README with copy commands referencing actual files
- Added markdown links to all template and script files for easy navigation
- Reduced README from ~1254 lines to ~965 lines (~290 lines removed)
- Renumbered steps 3.5-3.12 to 3.5-3.13 for proper sequencing
- Preserved only necessary heredocs: Dockerfile (users create in ralph-docker) and .gitignore append (small addition)
- Verified all 14 linked files exist and paths work as relative links

Files modified:
- README.md: Restructured to reference files instead of embedding
- prds/001_normalize_repo_structure.json: Marked task 003 complete

Commit: 337615c
Notes: README is now a proper documentation hub. All file contents are in actual files, README links to them.
