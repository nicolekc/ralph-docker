# Project Structure

How the framework files are organized in a project that uses Ralph.

## Two Directories

### `.orca/` — Framework Files (copied, don't edit)

Installed from the framework repo. Contains perspectives, processes, the seed, and templates. Treat as read-only. If the framework updates, these files get replaced.

```
.orca/
  seed.md                  # Working style principles
  ralph.md                 # Orchestrator instructions
  perspectives/
    architect.md
    code-cleaner.md
    code-reviewer.md
    design-reviewer.md
    explorer.md
    implementer.md
    planner.md
    qa-engineer.md
    spec-reviewer.md
  processes/
    prd.md                 # Pipeline model and task lifecycle
  templates/
    prd.json               # PRD template
```

### `orca-context/` — Project-Specific Files (your edits)

No dot — this is human-inspectable. Everything specific to this project. Starts nearly empty with bare templates. Grows as the project does.

```
orca-context/
  overrides/               # Additions to .orca/ (mirror the structure)
    perspectives/          # e.g., architect.md with project-specific context
  knowledge/               # One file per learning, append-only
  prds/                    # Durable: task definitions (PRD files)
  designs/                 # Durable: design documents, investigations
  tasks/                   # Durable per-task context (research, brain dumps, design notes)
    <prd-name>/
      <task-id>/
```

If an override needs to *subtract* from a framework file, that's a signal the framework file is too prescriptive. Fix the framework, don't hack the override.

### `orca-context/tasks/` — Durable Task Context

Task-specific context that humans prepare for agents or that emerges during design sessions. Research notes, brain dumps, design challenges, background material. This lives in `orca-context/` because it's human-inspectable and survives beyond task execution.

```
orca-context/tasks/
  <prd-name>/
    <task-id>/
      (research notes, design docs, brain dumps, etc.)
```

**What goes here:**
- Research or investigation notes prepared before task execution
- Design challenge documents with open questions
- Background material that gives the task implementer context beyond the PRD description
- Brain dumps from design sessions

## CLAUDE.md

The project's CLAUDE.md remains the primary project context file. The seed (`.orca/seed.md`) is a supplement, not a replacement. CLAUDE.md has project-specific commands, conventions, and context that the framework doesn't know about.

## Self-Installation

When the orca repo installs into itself:
- `framework/` is the **source** (canonical, edited by developers)
- `.orca/` is the **installed copy** (generated, overwritten on install)
- These are different directories — no conflict

## AGENTS.md Pattern

Projects can use `AGENTS.md` files in subdirectories to provide per-directory context to AI agents. These contain learnings, instructions, and conventions specific to the code in that directory. CLAUDE.md at the top level should instruct agents to read and write AGENTS.md files as they learn about the codebase.

The right balance for AGENTS.md writes is an open question — too liberal creates noise, too conservative loses knowledge. See the knowledge file on this topic if one exists.
