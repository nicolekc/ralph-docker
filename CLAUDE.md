# Ralph Framework

This repo is the Ralph agent framework — composable tools for AI-assisted software development. It is also self-hosting: the framework is installed into itself for development.

## What This Repo Contains

- `framework/` — **Source** of framework files (roles, processes, seed, templates). This is the canonical version, edited by developers.
- `.ralph/` — **Installed copy** of `framework/`. Generated by the install process. Don't edit directly — edit `framework/` and re-install.
- `ralph-context/` — Project-specific files for developing this repo (overrides, knowledge, designs, PRDs)
- `.ralph-tasks/` — Per-task workspaces (investigation notes, progress, brain dumps)
- `docs/` — Framework design documentation
- `.claude/skills/` — Claude Code skills (`/ralph`, `/discover`, `/refine`)
- Docker/bash infrastructure — `Dockerfile`, `ralph-start.sh`, `ralph-loop.sh`, etc.

## Essential Reading (MUST READ before any work)

1. **`docs/design-principles.md`** — 11 principles that govern ALL framework design decisions. Read this first. Every design choice should trace back to a principle here. The most important ones:
   - **P2 (Principles Over Prescriptions)** — Don't add rigid rules. State principles, trust the executor.
   - **P3 (Specification-Creativity Tradeoff)** — Over-specifying tasks REDUCES quality. Give context and intent, not recipes.
   - **P8 (Lightning-Quick Descriptions)** — Every file an AI reads costs tokens. Be minimal.

2. **`docs/structure.md`** — How framework files are organized in any project using Ralph

3. **`docs/execution-strategies.md`** — Two modes: subagent (subscription) and bash loop (API/Docker)

## Framework Design Anti-Patterns (observed, not theoretical)

These come from analysis of OMC (~30 agents), Superpowers (~14 skills), and Gas Town (Go CLI). All three are MIT licensed. See `.ralph-tasks/001-bootstrap/001/frameworks-research.md` for the full analysis.

- **The prescriptiveness trap**: More "MUST do X" rules → more corner cases → more patches → explosion in complexity. AI-designed frameworks are especially susceptible because AI has no pressure toward simplicity.
- **Anti-rationalization tables**: Preemptively blocking the AI from making excuses is an adversarial arms race. Trust and correct after, don't pre-empt.
- **Over-classification of roles**: 30 separate agent types creates a routing problem. Keep roles broad.
- **Custom vocabulary**: Invented terminology (polecats, beads, convoys) wastes tokens and confuses.
- **Mandatory activation**: "If 1% chance a skill applies, MUST invoke it" creates overhead. Let the AI decide.

## Git Rules

- NEVER push to main directly
- Always work on feature branches
- Make small, logical commits with clear messages

## How to Run /ralph

In a Claude Code session:
```
/ralph ralph-context/prds/001-bootstrap.json
```

Ralph reads the PRD, dispatches subagents for each task (architect → implement → review), commits, and pushes when done.

## Project-Specific Context

This framework is being built by a human (Nicole) who has worked extensively with AI-assisted development on the Promptly project (160+ tasks). Key hard-won insights from that experience are encoded in the design principles, especially P3 (Specification-Creativity Tradeoff). The framework exists because:

1. Existing frameworks (OMC, Superpowers, Gas Town) are all-or-nothing monoliths
2. They prescribe too many rigid commands and structures
3. They were largely AI-designed and exhibit runaway complexity
4. Nicole needs a composable toolkit that she actually controls

The goal is NOT to build another comprehensive agent framework. It IS to build small, independent, reusable tools that compose well and avoid the prescriptiveness trap.

## Key Knowledge Files

- `ralph-context/knowledge/novel-verification-methods.md` — How to create verification infrastructure when existing tools don't cover something. Meta-cognitive pattern, not a tool list.
- `ralph-context/knowledge/principle-adherence-risks.md` — Known risks of principle drift. Architects and reviewers should reference this.
- `.ralph-tasks/001-bootstrap/002/design-philosophy.md` — What the framework IS and ISN'T. The Promptly experience.
- `.ralph-tasks/001-bootstrap/001/frameworks-research.md` — Full OMC/Superpowers/Gas Town analysis.
