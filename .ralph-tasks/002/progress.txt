Task 002: Refine and test the /ralph skill end-to-end
Status: pending

Context:
- The /ralph skill (.claude/skills/ralph/SKILL.md) is written but untested
- It needs to work in an interactive Claude Code session on subscription plan
- The skill dispatches subagents via the Task tool
- Each subagent gets: role prompt content, task description, accumulated context
- The build cycle is: architect -> implement -> review -> (fix -> review)* -> done
- See framework/ralph.md for full orchestrator instructions
- See framework/processes/build-cycle.md for the cycle definition
- Must handle: task dependencies, parallel independent tasks, circuit breaker at 3 rounds
- The skill references .ralph/ paths which must exist (self-installed in this repo)
