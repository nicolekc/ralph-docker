## Context
Investigation: parallelization principles for ralph task execution.
New task — didn't exist in the original 001-bootstrap PRD.

## Background
- framework/ralph.md says "One task at a time unless tasks are explicitly independent (then dispatch in parallel)"
- build-cycle.md has a brief "Parallel Tasks" section
- Key questions to investigate:
  - File conflict detection when parallel tasks modify overlapping files
  - Shared test infrastructure (one task breaks tests another task depends on)
  - When is parallelization safe vs risky?
  - How do investigation tasks (non-code) parallelize vs code tasks?
- Should be informed by real experience from PRD 002 if available
