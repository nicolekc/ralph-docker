## Context
Investigation: AGENTS.md pattern — right balance for per-directory knowledge.
Originally task 004 in the monolithic 001-bootstrap PRD.

## Background
- AGENTS.md files provide per-directory hints to AI agents
- Some implementations are too liberal (write noise after every change)
- Some are too conservative (never write anything)
- docs/structure.md has a brief section noting this is an open question
- Key questions: what triggers a write? what content is useful vs noise? how to prevent staleness?

## Sources to Research
- How CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md are used in practice in open-source projects
- OMC/Superpowers/Gas Town approaches to per-directory context
- The CLAUDE.md in this repo as an example of good project-level context

## Deliverable
Findings document with concrete recommendations. NON-CODE — needs human review.
