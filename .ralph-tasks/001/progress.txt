Task 001: Update install script for new structure
Status: pending

Context:
- The install script (install.sh) currently copies old-style files (RALPH_PROMPT.md, etc.)
- It needs to also copy framework/ -> .ralph/ in the target project
- It needs to create ralph-context/ and .ralph-tasks/ directories
- The /ralph skill needs to be included in the install
- When installing into ralph-docker itself, framework/ is source, .ralph/ is the installed copy
- See docs/structure.md for the full layout
- PRD_REFINE.md from the existing prds/ directory is EXCELLENT and should be preserved/integrated
