## Context
Design two-mode operation: PRD auto-execution and enhanced vibe coding.
New task (DRAFT status — not ready for execution).

## Background
- Initial thinking captured in ralph-context/knowledge/two-modes.md
- PRD execution = /ralph skill, automated build cycle, subagent dispatch
- Vibe coding = human-driven interactive session, ralph's tools "lying around"
- Key insight: most real development alternates between both modes
- Framework should support both without forcing either
- The framework files are already usable in both modes — this design makes it explicit
