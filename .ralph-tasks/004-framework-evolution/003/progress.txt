## Context
Adapt additional role prompts from open-source frameworks.
Originally task 010 in the monolithic 001-bootstrap PRD.

## Background
- See role-adaptation-notes.md in this directory for source analysis
- All source frameworks are MIT licensed (OMC, Superpowers, Gas Town)
- Strip rigid commands and custom vocabulary; keep engineering principles
- Each new role should follow the same pattern as existing roles in framework/roles/
- Don't create roles speculatively — add them when needed by actual tasks
- Should incorporate findings from principle adherence investigation (PRD 003, task 002)
- The design review "round table" process is a priority (multiple perspectives)
