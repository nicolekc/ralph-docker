## Context
Adapt Docker infrastructure for multi-repo.
Originally task 007 in the monolithic 001-bootstrap PRD.

## Background
- Current ralph-start.sh assumes one Docker container = one repo
- Need to support multiple project repos in a single container
- See docker-multi-repo.md in this directory for design challenges and open questions
- Don't over-design — start with the simplest multi-mount approach and iterate
- Keep the bash runner (ralph-loop.sh) working alongside subagent mode
- Also document multi-level installation pattern (ralph-docker alongside target projects)
