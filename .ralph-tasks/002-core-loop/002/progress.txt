## Context
This task validates the spec review gate and progress.txt conventions.
New task — didn't exist in the original 001-bootstrap PRD.

## Background
- Spec reviewer role was enhanced with success criteria format and problem statement checks
- Build cycle now includes optional spec review gate as step 0
- Progress.txt conventions documented in docs/structure.md
- This task should intentionally include a vague criterion in a test PRD to verify the spec reviewer catches it
