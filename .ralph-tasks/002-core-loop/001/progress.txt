## Context
Test and refine the /ralph skill end-to-end.
Originally task 003 in the monolithic 001-bootstrap PRD.

## Background
- Needs a small test PRD (2-3 tasks) — do NOT use a bootstrap PRD
- Verify: subagent dispatch via Task tool, architect/implementer/reviewer cycle
- Verify: task state updates, .ralph-tasks/ gets populated
- Test: circuit breaker (reviewer keeps rejecting, max 3 rounds)
- Test: signoff gates ("architecture" signoff stops after architect phase)
- Fix any issues discovered during the test

## Dependencies
- Requires PRD 001-foundation tasks (testability, install.sh) to be complete
