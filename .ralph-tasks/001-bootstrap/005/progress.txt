Task 005: Integrate existing PRD_REFINE.md wisdom into framework
Status: pending

Context:
- The existing prds/PRD_REFINE.md is excellent — it already embodies many design principles
- Key sections worth preserving: Implementer Trust Balance, Specification-Creativity balance,
  Concrete Examples Are Valuable, acceptance criteria quality, investigation task patterns
- This content should be integrated into the framework, probably as:
  - Parts in framework/roles/spec-reviewer.md (enhanced)
  - Parts in a framework process for PRD creation
  - The /refine skill should reference the framework's version
- Don't lose the existing content — it represents hard-won experience from Promptly
- The tentative language pattern ("something like this should work") is a key insight
