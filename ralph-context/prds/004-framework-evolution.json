The existing prds/PRD_REFINE.md contains hard-won insights: implementer trust balance, specification-creativity balance, concrete examples with tentative language, investigation task patterns, acceptance criteria quality. Split appropriately between an enhanced spec-reviewer role and a PRD authoring process. Don't lose content — it's battle-tested from 160+ Promptly tasks.",
