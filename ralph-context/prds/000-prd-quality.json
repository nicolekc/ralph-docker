Current verification criteria are bare — many describe existence ('document exists') rather than behavior, or are vague about what 'works' means. Apply the success-criteria-format.md pattern (who does what, what happens, how you observe it) and the novel-verification-methods.md thinking (what are we verifying, why can't we verify it with existing tools, what would give us visibility) to propose strengthened verification for every task across PRDs 001-004. Also review outcomes for specificity. This is a PROPOSAL — produce a document with current vs proposed verification for each task. NON-CODE DELIVERABLE — needs human review before PRDs are updated.",
