Current verification criteria are bare — many describe existence ('document exists') rather than behavior, or are vague about what 'works' means. Propose strengthened verification for every task across PRDs 001-004. Also review outcomes for specificity. This is a PROPOSAL — not direct changes to PRDs. NON-CODE DELIVERABLE — needs human review before PRDs are updated.",
