  "description": "Complete the bootstrap by cleaning up artifacts from the old framework structure and rewriting existing PRDs to be outcome-only. This is the first PRD the framework executes after bootstrapping — it finishes what the manual bootstrap started.

The architect phase handles the HOW now. Each PRD should describe WHAT outcome is needed and WHY, with clear verification criteria, but leave implementation approach to the architect. Preserve the human checkpoint structure (PRDs are ordered by complexity). Don't lose valuable context — move implementation hints into ralph-context/tasks/ as durable context if they'd help the architect.",

Think about what a developer actually needs when they first adopt this — not just file placement, but understanding what was set up and what to do next.",
