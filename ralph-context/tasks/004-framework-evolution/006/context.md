# Task Context: Framework README

## Background

The README is the front door. It should make the framework understandable to someone seeing it for the first time.

## Key Content Considerations

- The six project primitives: Seed, Knowledge Convention, PRD Format, State System, Role Definitions, Orchestrator Pattern
- Partial adoption is important: someone might want the PRD format and roles but not the orchestrator; someone might want the seed pattern but not the state system. The README should make these paths visible.
- Should be informed by the naming/organization audit (003/008) and the six design docs (004/002) if available, but doesn't block on them.
- Explain what the framework IS in plain language.
