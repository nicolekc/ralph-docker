# Task Context: Blog Post / Positioning Piece

## Background

WHY.md currently serves as a glanceable conversation starter — the "zoom call" version of the framework's philosophy. This task extends it into a long-form narrative.

## Creative Direction

- Style reference: Steve Yegge-style narrative. Think Gas Town's "Welcome to Gas Town" post but for this framework's philosophy.
- The story: 160+ tasks on Promptly that led here, frameworks tried and rejected (OMC, Superpowers, Gas Town), the counterintuitive discovery about specification vs creativity, and the vision for where this goes.
- Should incorporate the competitive analysis (vs OMC, Superpowers, Gas Town) in a way that's fair but clear about what's different.

## Audience

Technical PMs, founders using AI to build, solo developers who've felt the pain of AI-assisted development but don't know what to call it. Should be readable by a non-engineer PM.

## Constraints

- This is a DRAFT — needs heavy human editing since voice matters
- Should tell a narrative, not just list features
- Must address the "doesn't Claude Code already do this?" objection directly
