# Task Context: Update install.sh

## Problem Statement

**Discovered:** The current install.sh copies old-style files (RALPH_PROMPT.md at repo root, etc.) that no longer match the framework structure. The framework has been reorganized into framework/ → .ralph/ with roles/, processes/, templates/ subdirectories, plus ralph-context/ and .ralph-tasks/ conventions.

**Why it matters:** install.sh is how other projects adopt the framework. If it's broken, nobody can use ralph-docker. It's also how the self-hosting works (ralph-docker installs into itself).

**What was tried:** The current install.sh was written for the original flat structure. It needs a complete rewrite for the new directory layout.

**Constraints:**
- Backward compatibility with the old layout is NOT required (only Promptly used it, and Promptly will be updated separately)
- Self-installation (when the target IS ralph-docker) must not create circular copies — framework/ is the source, .ralph/ is the installed copy
- The existing PRD_REFINE.md content is valuable and should be preserved somewhere in the framework
- Must create: .ralph/ (from framework/), ralph-context/ (bare structure with overrides/, knowledge/, prds/, designs/, tasks/), .ralph-tasks/ (empty, agents create during execution), .claude/skills/ (ralph, discover, refine)

## Self-Installation Edge Case

When ralph-docker installs into itself:
- framework/ already exists (it's the source)
- .ralph/ should be a copy of framework/
- ralph-context/ and .ralph-tasks/ already exist (they're being used for development)
- The script should detect self-install and skip creating things that already exist with project-specific content

## Files to Reference

- Current install.sh (read it first to understand what exists)
- docs/structure.md (the target layout)
- framework/ directory tree (the source to copy)
- .claude/skills/ directory (skills to copy)
